# BookStore-Customer-Retention-and-Spending-Analysis

This repository showcases a data analysis project undertaken for a bookstore client. The primary objectives were to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and develop Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to derive actionable insights and predict key outcomes based on the provided dataset.

Project Overview
The project is divided into two main components, each implemented in separate Jupyter Notebooks:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process involved cleaning, profiling, and visualizing the bookstore data to uncover underlying trends and patterns. Advanced Python libraries such as Dataprep and Sweetviz were utilized to generate comprehensive visualizations and data profiles. While Python's built-in visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib and Seaborn) could have been employed, the use of Dataprep and Sweetviz allowed for quicker, automated, and detailed visual insights, aligning better with the scope and timeline of the project.

Machine Learning Algorithm Development
Another notebook focuses on the development and testing of Machine Learning models. Python was used to create and evaluate algorithms to solve predictive problems, leveraging libraries such as Scikit-learn for modeling and performance evaluation. The models were designed to provide the client with valuable predictions and insights to support decision-making.

Key Features
Automated data profiling and visualization using Dataprep and Sweetviz, providing a high-level overview of the dataset and its statistical properties.
Custom visualizations and in-depth analysis of specific features to answer key business questions.
Implementation of Machine Learning algorithms for predictive analysis, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
Clear documentation and modular code for reproducibility and adaptability.
Tools and Technologies
Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Dataprep, Sweetviz.
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebooks.
This repository not only demonstrates the application of advanced data analysis techniques but also showcases a well-structured approach to solving real-world business problems. It is an excellent example of how data-driven methodologies can help clients make informed decisions.

Potential employers are encouraged to explore the notebooks to see how technical proficiency and domain knowledge were applied to achieve the project's objectives.
